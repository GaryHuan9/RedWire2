all gates have one output port and 1 to 3 input ports
inverter: output is high if the number of input highs is even (xnor)
transistor: output is high if all connected inputs are high (and)

bridge: not a gate, but provide horizontal and vertical bypassing, can also add optional spillage so horizontal highs are outputted to vertical or vice versa
tunnel: signal connection between neighboring layers
the graphics for these two can simply contain an extra carved out section that is colored with the wire, pointing towards the output direction

one we way to make supporting modules easier is by disallowing the placement of gates near a module's edge.
or we can simply draw a box around the module and say gates do not work across boundaries.

TODO:
V add inverter and transistor
V support connecting to gates around wires
- begin work on wire update engine
- support copy and pasting
- support saving and loading files
- create and use PositionMap and PositionSet to accelerate searching
- add greedy meshing (single axis)
- add vertex buffer batching between chunks
- add modules system
