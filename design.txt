all gates have one output port and 1 to 3 input ports
inverter: output is high if the number of input highs is even (xnor)
transistor: output is high if all connected inputs are high (and)

bridge: not a gate, but provide horizontal and vertical bypassing, can also add optional spillage so horizontal highs are outputted to vertical or vice versa
tunnel: signal connection between neighboring layers
